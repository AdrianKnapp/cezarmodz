## CezarModz

Hello! this is a big project, who I've did to a client some months ago. CezarModz is an e-commerce, selling GTA V accounts about 2 years ago. In this job, I've learned the most part of my knowledges, like advanced PHP, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Jquery, Payment API, and some hard techniques about CSS.

## Be atemption

The CezarModz is a opensource web site, and some files had to be added to .gitignore, because they have some sensive data. So, if you need this files, do contact with me, and we talk about.
